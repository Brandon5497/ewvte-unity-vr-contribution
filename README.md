# Electromagnetic Warfare Virtual Training Environment (EWVTE)
*Unity • C# • XR Interaction Toolkit • New Input System*

This repository documents my **individual contributions** to a multi-person Unity project developed as part of a senior design course.

The EWVTE project is a **VR and desktop-compatible training environment** designed for electromagnetic warfare mission planning and spectrum visualization on a tabletop interface.

> **Note:** The full source code is maintained in a separate team repository and is not publicly available.  
> This repository exists solely to describe my technical contributions.

## Project Overview
EWVTE allows users to:
- Place and manipulate battlefield assets on a virtual tabletop
- Visualize RF coverage using cones, spheres, and heatmaps
- Switch between **VR** and **desktop** interaction modes
- Control scene tools through an in-world toolbar UI

The system was developed collaboratively by a senior design team following an Agile workflow.

## My Contributions

### Input & Interaction
- Integrated Unity’s **New Input System** into existing interaction logic
- Debugged controller input issues affecting both VR and desktop modes
- Assisted with hand-preference logic for toolbar placement

### UI & Tooling
- Fixed **UI panel interaction** and raycasting issues in VR
- Helped stabilize toolbar behavior across interaction modes
- Assisted with UI debugging and layout corrections

### Systems & Logic
- Contributed to **Centralized Object Management System (COMS)** logic
- Assisted with object placement and interaction workflows
- Helped debug object state inconsistencies during runtime

### Collaboration
- Worked in a multi-person **Git-based workflow**
- Participated in sprint planning, testing, and bug-fix iterations
